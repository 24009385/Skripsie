Why we thread one way or another DC vs AC clock might effect the bias. go test it and see if it affects the output.
Speak about why we cant make an XOR gate with MAJ logic only AND and OR and have to cerate XOR with complex logic.
AND yes you can nest a sub circuit within a sub circuit, go test it and make buffer 40 deep to see if output is affected.
Majority gates do work you knob just look at the coupling you coupled your inductors wrong, thank you sir. ....testd it and do they really work?
