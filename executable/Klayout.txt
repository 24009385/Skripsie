Apparently, I do not use shunt resistance, AQFP is not shunted.

To import other cells as ...something f.cell ?

Use partial to move the metal edge to contact the junction.

Cant amke a voltage source in Klayout so we instead of ground to current source we make a VCC pin in Klayout.

Resistors bleed current in a pattern that decreases the resistive width or increase absynth can do thi calculation for you.


Flux trapping don't use solid ground plane, draw a flux trapping moat. There are also rules to creating the moats in the document. 
Edit select 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 edit cut or something to remove the moats for flux trapping.


this is in the inductex netlist
Need to check everything is correct using inductex. 

As a rule every grounded junction becomes a port? ...this is in the inductex netlist
Place terminal path along entire width of the input, output, clock input and random places maybe grounds too?

For junction on Klayout do not need to dra or add a terminal just drop the text in the hole the inductex will find it.
