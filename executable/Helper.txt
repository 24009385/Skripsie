josim -o ./Name.csv test.cir  
-- This runs the netlist in test.cir and outputs a csv file called Name


josim  -o ./Name.csv ./test.cir -v 1
-- Runs a verbose analysis and store as mentioned previously 
-- V1 min info V2 more info V3 most info 

josim -a 1 -o ./Name.csv test.cir 
-- May run a phase analysis and store as mentioned previously 

-- there is a .include which includes other files into data currently being processed. Not sure how to use this just yet.

Component List:
B --Josephson Junction only one at present
C -- Capacitor
E -- Voltage comtrolled voltage source (VCVS)
F -- current controlled current source (CCCS)
G -- Voltage controlled current source (VCCS)
H -- Current controlled voltage source (CCVS)
I -- Current source 
K -- Mutal inductance 
L -- Inductor 
P -- Phase source
R -- Resistor 
T -- Transmission Line
V -- Voltage source

Values of components: 

Suffix		Meaning		Engineering Notation Equivalent
F		Femto		1E-15
P		Pico		1E-12
N		Nano		1E-9
U		Micro		1E-6
M		Milli		1E-3
K		Kilo		1E3
MEG		Mega		1E6
X		Mega		1E6
G		Giga		1E9
T		Tera		1E12

Note that K in JoSIM will be interpreted as kilo meaning a temperature of 4Kelvin 
If written as 4K will be interpreted as 4000 Kelvin.

When placing a component it is always:
ComponentName PositiveTerminal NegativeTerminal Value

Mutual Inductance --K
K	L1	L2	Value

.tran 	Step	Stop

Sinusoidal Wave will be 
sin(Offset 	A	[f	[Td	[theta]]])
